    BEFORE LAUNCH

    -------

    AFTER LAUNCH

    - watch url for note id and go to that note so linking can happen

    - if you use socketio, then the sockets must be attached to individual notes, not the entire application

    - COOL IDEA for Collaborative Editing
        - on sharing notes, you can only add your own nodes, not edit another user's
        - then there is a color coded legend of each nodes correspsonding author

    Just going to vamp a little bit on the idea of archive/folders.  What might be cool is this:
        Notes on your desk in the main column cannot be tagged or put into folders
        this is the main view ( ok they can be tagged but it is more encouraged as a part of the archiving process, so no buttons for sorting by tag on the main view, but searching by tag would of course work)

        when you archive a note, you are prompted with your categories to file it in

        the archive view is a different view, where you cannot write, but see things sorted .... lots of opportunity for excellent design stuff here. Intuiative ways to sort through your ideas INCLUDING WITH A CALENDER VIEW
            ah...the possibilties


    - 50 Note max
        - prompt to empty archive, or download archive for more room
        - $10 for a year?
            - let them know what cool things are on the way
            - let them know it is private, no investment

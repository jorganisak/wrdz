<p>Wrdz is web application that I made for writing and sharing small thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>Think of it as something between tweeting and blogging.</p>
<p>I built Wrdz for fun, to learn, and to prove that I could create a non-trivial web product.</p>
<p>Wrdz is built using Angular, node.js, and mongoDB.  I have overseen the project from conception to its current state.</p>
